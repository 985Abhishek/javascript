    <p>Full Stack Development refers to the development of both front end(client side) and back end(server side) portions of web application.

        Full stack web Developers
        Full stack web developers have the ability to design complete web applications and websites. They work on the frontend, backend, database and debugging of web applications or websites.
        Technology Related to Full Stack Development
        Front-end Development
        It is the visible part of website or web application which is responsible for user experience. The user directly interacts with the front end portion of the web application or website.
        
        Front-end Technologies:
        The front end portion is built by using some languages which are discussed below:</p>

    <p> HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the programming language used to build the internet. It is the standard language for web programming, along with CSS and JavaScript. This open-format, text-based type code is extremely versatile, and can be used to embed additional programming languages such as JavaScript. HTML is made up of different elements called tags that dictate the structure of the webpage that are then translated by a web browser into a user-friendly form.

 <p>Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independently of the HTML that makes up each web page. It describes how a webpage should look: it prescribes colours, fonts, spacing, and much more. In short, you can make your website look however you want. CSS lets developers and designers define how it behaves, including how elements are positioned in the browser.

While HTML uses tags, CSS uses rulesets. CSS is easy to learn and understand, but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document.</p>

 <h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>

<p>JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by several websites for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document. It was introduced in the year 1995 for adding programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigator browser. Since then, it has been adopted by all other graphical web browsers. With JavaScript, users can build modern web applications to interact directly without reloading the page every time. The traditional website uses js to provide several forms of interactivity and simplicity.
 Although, JavaScript has no connectivity with Java programming language. The name was suggested and provided in the times when Java was gaining popularity in the market. In addition to web browsers, databases such as CouchDB and MongoDB uses JavaScript as their scripting and query language.
  Features of JavaScript
    There are following features of JavaScript:
                                        
  All popular web browsers support JavaScript as they provide built-in execution environments.
     JavaScript follows the syntax and structure of the C programming language. Thus, it is a structured programming language.
JavaScript is a weakly typed language, where certain types are implicitly cast (depending on the operation).
 JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that uses prototypes rather than using classes for inheritance.
